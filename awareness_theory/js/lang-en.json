  "prologueTitle": "PROLOGUE: THE QUESTION THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING",
  "prologueText": "It all started with a simple question that science has no direct answer to: where does the wave function collapse occur? The search for a solution led to the creation of a new map of reality, in which consciousness and matter are not two different entities, but two aspects of one fundamental process.",
  
  "ontologyTitle": "NEW ONTOLOGY — FIRST PRINCIPLES",
  "realityIsRing": "REALITY IS THE \"RING\"",
  "realityText": "Reality is not matter or field. Reality is the \"Ring\". A single, holistic act of connection that we conventionally divide into \"input\" (beginning of the \"Ring\") and \"output\" (collapse). Imagine a doorway between rooms. You cannot say that one side is the \"cause\" and the other is the \"effect\"—they exist only together. In exactly the same way, the \"Ring\" is not a sequence, but the bridge itself between potential and actual. Everything you perceive as reality is the product of countless \"Rings\".",

  "fieldEntityText": "Definition: Fundamental nondiscrete continuum. Potential of all possible reality. Has no form, time, or any content. This is \"raw\" reality before its awareness. Important: FE is not a \"space\" where QAs float. It's potential for the Act of Awareness.<br> Analogy: Infinite unmanifested ocean. (conventionally — one side of the door).",
  
  "quantumTitle": "QUANTUM OF AWARENESS (QA)/\"RING\"",
  "quantumText": "Status: Primary act of reality. Not a process, but a state.<br>Definition: A single ontological event that can be described in two inseparable aspects:<br>Aspect QA: Discrete, point-like unit of awareness. (\"Drop\").<br>Aspect \"Ring\": Holistic, unfolded connection that actualizes this unit in experience. (\"Smeared oval\" from the drop).<br>Key principle: Not \"QA is created in the Ring\", but \"QA and Ring are two ways of speaking about the same act of awareness\". <br>There is no temporal or causal gap between them.<br>Analogy: The moment when you already understood a joke (\"Aha!\"). Your \"Aha!\" is the conscious QA, which is the completed Ring.<br>It's impossible to find the moment \"between\" not understanding and understanding.<br> Analogy: A single drop taken from the ocean. The very act of scooping is the birth of the drop.",
  
  "oceanTitle": "OCEAN OF BACKGROUND",
  "oceanText": "Definition: Not a separate entity, but a localized and structured part of the Field-Entity itself. Dynamic region of FE involved in a stable configuration. Not the brain. The brain is an interface for connecting OB with QA.<br>Analogy: A bucket in the river with the same water.",
  
  "observerTitle": "OBSERVER",

QA is new, interesting; the brain enjoys exploring all its connections.<br>Resistance of Misunderstanding: High S. QA is alien; the brain struggles to find any similar patterns.<br>Resistance of Feeblemindedness: High S. Fundamental limitation due to low brain \"plasticity\" or fatigue.",

  "emotionMechanism": "Mechanism: A powerful \"Ring\" (e.g., awareness of a threat) ends with collapse.",
  "emotionResult": "Result: This collapse generates an emotion (fright), which is a signal and simultaneously modifies the Ocean of Background, creating a new pattern.",
  "emotionEssence": "Essence: You don't get scared and then realize the threat. You realize the threat, and this realization is the fright.",
  
  "timeTitle": "SUBJECTIVE TIME IS A MEASURE OF THOUGHT RESISTANCE",
  "timeMechanism": "Mechanism: In the \"flow\" state (high Interest, complex task) resistance (`S`) is high but desirable. QA \"lingers\" in the connection process, passing fewer \"Rings\" per unit of astronomical time. Time \"compresses\".",
  "timeEssence": "Essence: Clocks tick evenly. The density of awareness acts on their segment is different.",
  
  "creativeBlockTitle": "CREATIVE BLOCK IS OBSERVER'S LOOPING",
  "creativeBlockMechanism": "Mechanism: The \"Observer\" tries to guide QA through old \"Tunnels\" (patterns) that don't work. Resistance (`S`) is maximal. The \"Ring\" cannot close — this is the \"Entanglement\" state.",
  "creativeBlockSolution": "Solution (from the theory): Don't simplify the task, but dramatically complicate it (\"Going Beyond the Boundary\"). This breaks old patterns, forcing the system to find new ones.",
  "creativeBlockEssence": "Essence: Creativity is not generating new from nothing, but resetting rigid filters that prevent new connections from establishing.",
  
  "memoryTitle": "MEMORY IS NOT A RECORDING, BUT RECONSTRUCTION",
  "memoryMechanism": "Mechanism: Remembering is not extracting a file. It's a new act of awareness — connecting QA with patterns in the Ocean of Background <em>here and now</em>.",
  "memoryResult": "Result: Memory is rewritten each time during recollection, explaining its variability.",
  
  "practiceTitle": "PRACTICE — REALITY MANAGEMENT TOOLS",

  "tool1Essence": "Essence: You're not \"relaxing\". You're forcibly rebooting a system crash (\"Observer\").",
  
  "tool2Title": "TOOL #2: \"GOING BEYOND THE BOUNDARY\"",
  "tool2Why": "Why?<br> For solving unsolvable tasks, breakthrough in creativity, exiting \"Meaning Vacuum\".",

  "tool3How": "How?<br> 1. Rest, sleep.<br>2. Reducing `Noise_Context` (turn off notifications).<br>3. Simple, automatic tasks.",
  "tool3Essence": "Essence: This is not just \"rest\". It's forced shutdown of the Observer and reduction of Flow_QA to a minimum level so the system switches to background recovery mode.",
